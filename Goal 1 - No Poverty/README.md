# No Poverty

**This goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce poverty rates in all countries. Poverty is a complex and multidimensional problem that affects millions of people worldwide, and achieving this goal requires addressing the root causes of poverty, including lack of access to education, healthcare, and basic services. This goal recognizes that poverty is not just about income but also about access to opportunities and resources, and it calls for a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction that includes social protection programs, targeted investments, and inclusive economic growth.**

**The first SDG goal, "No Poverty," aims to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce poverty rates in all countries. It recognizes that poverty is a complex issue with multifaceted dimensions, including lack of income, access to basic services, education, and opportunities. Achieving this goal requires targeted interventions to empower the poor, promote inclusive economic growth, ensure social protection systems, and create sustainable livelihoods. It involves addressing factors such as inequality, social exclusion, and lack of access to resources, while also promoting economic opportunities and social safety nets that uplift individuals and communities out of poverty.**

## No Poverty SDG Goal 1 Target parameters and Expectations üìë

**The targets for this goal include reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, ensuring equal rights to economic resources, and improving access to basic services such as education, health, and social protection.  Goal 1 of the SDGs is "No Poverty." This goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, and to ensure that all people have access to basic resources and services such as education, healthcare, and social protection.**

**To achieve this goal, the SDGs have set several targets, including :**

- **1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.**
- **1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.**
- **1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.**
- **1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular, the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance.**
- **1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.**
- **1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.**

**The targets for Goal 1 reflect the importance of addressing poverty in all its dimensions, including income poverty, lack of access to basic services.**

## Tackling Economic Growth üìà

**Economic equality and growth are essential components of reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. Here are some ways in which a nation can work towards achieving economic equality and growth:**

1. **Promote inclusive economic growth üìà A nation can promote inclusive economic growth by creating an environment that enables businesses to thrive, creating jobs, and generating income. This can be achieved by investing in infrastructure, providing access to credit and financial services, and promoting entrepreneurship and innovation.**
2. **Invest in education and skills development üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Investing in education and skills development can help people acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the economy and increase their earning potential. This can be achieved by improving access to education, vocational training, and lifelong learning opportunities.**
3. **Develop a progressive tax system üèó A progressive tax system can help redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. A nation can achieve this by implementing tax policies that are fair and progressive, and by using the revenue generated to fund social programs and services that benefit the most vulnerable members of society.**
4. **Strengthen social protection programs ‚öî Social protection programs, such as cash transfers, food subsidies, and healthcare benefits, can help alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality. A nation can strengthen social protection programs by expanding coverage, improving the targeting of beneficiaries, and increasing the amount of benefits provided.**
5. **Address gender inequality üöπ Gender inequality is a significant barrier to economic growth and poverty reduction. A nation can promote gender equality by implementing policies and programs that address gender-based discrimination and promote equal opportunities for women in education, employment, and entrepreneurship.**
6. **Promote sustainable development üåø‚ôª Sustainable development promotes economic growth that is environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive. A nation can achieve this by investing in renewable energy, promoting sustainable agriculture, and implementing policies and programs that protect natural resources and ecosystems.**

**In conclusion, achieving economic equality and growth is a complex process that requires a comprehensive approach. By promoting inclusive economic growth, investing in education and skills development, developing a progressive tax system, strengthening social protection programs, addressing gender inequality, and promoting sustainable development, a nation can work towards reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development.**

# Empowering the Marginalized üè´

‚Äú **A project focused on providing access to education, skills development, and employment opportunities to marginalized communities to help lift them out of poverty.**‚Äù

**EtM will provide educational tools and resources for sustainable skill development programs which will increase the skillset of many workers of the poor nations which can be employed by local businesses or foreign investments to support their work. This way the workers can either generate income via jobs and salaries or through progressive economic development and starting their own businesses which doesn‚Äôt take away the workforce / labour factor from the country. Yet the government needs to ensure good economic systems are to be put in place to ensure that the living standards do improve to keep the newly educated labour in place and settled with good lifestyle to further increase worker morale and work yield per worker.**
