# Life below Water
**The fourteenth SDG goal, "Life Below Water," aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. It recognizes that the health and well-being of human societies are closely linked to the health and well-being of the oceans and the life that inhabits them. This goal encompasses efforts to reduce marine pollution, enhance marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, promote sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, and enhance ocean governance and cooperation. It also focuses on promoting ocean literacy and education, enhancing scientific research and knowledge-sharing, and promoting sustainable and responsible tourism in coastal areas.**

## Targets and Parameters for SDG Goal 14 ðŸ’º

**SDG Goal 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. The targets and parameters for this goal are as follows:**

- **By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.**
- **By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.**
- **By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices, and implement science-based management plans, to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.**
- **By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.**
- **Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources.**

### Business Ideas for SDG Goal 14 ðŸª‘

**Some business ideas for SDG Goal 14 could include:**

- **Sustainable seafood: A business could focus on sustainably sourcing and selling seafood to consumers, while also advocating for sustainable fishing practices and educating customers on the importance of ocean conservation.**
- **Marine tourism: A business could promote sustainable tourism practices and offer eco-friendly experiences, such as snorkeling or scuba diving tours that emphasize the importance of protecting the marine environment.**
- **Ocean monitoring technology: A business could develop and sell technology to monitor ocean health and detect pollution or overfishing, providing valuable data for governments and conservation organizations to inform policy and management decisions.**
- **Marine conservation education: A business could provide education and training on marine conservation to individuals, communities, and organizations, empowering them to take action and protect the oceans.**
- **Ocean cleanup: A business could focus on developing and implementing innovative solutions for cleaning up ocean pollution, such as designing and manufacturing ocean cleanup vessels or developing new methods for removing plastic waste from the ocean.**

# SustainAqua ðŸŒŠ

**Business idea point 3 for SDG Goal 14 involves promoting sustainable aquaculture practices to support the growth of the industry while minimizing its negative impact on the environment. A potential project could be the development of an aquaculture technology that maximizes the efficiency of fish farming while minimizing the environmental impact.**

**The project could focus on using innovative technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of fish farming. This could include the development of closed-loop aquaculture systems that recycle water and waste, the use of renewable energy sources to power aquaculture facilities, and the use of natural and sustainable feed sources.**

**The project could also involve working with local communities and governments to promote sustainable fishing practices and establish marine protected areas to protect marine biodiversity. By promoting sustainable aquaculture practices, this project could help to support the growth of the industry while protecting the ocean ecosystem.**

**SustainAqua is a project aimed at achieving SDG Goal 14: Life Below Water. The project focuses on promoting sustainable use and management of aquatic resources, particularly in coastal regions and small island developing states (SIDS). The goal is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources, while reducing the negative impacts of human activities on the marine environment.**

**One of the key components of SustainAqua is the implementation of sustainable fishing practices. Unsustainable fishing practices, such as overfishing and destructive fishing methods, are one of the main causes of the decline in fish populations and other marine species. Through SustainAqua, a business could work with local communities and governments to promote sustainable fishing practices, such as using gear that minimizes bycatch and implementing quotas and regulations to ensure fish populations can replenish.**

**Another important aspect of SustainAqua is the reduction of marine pollution. Marine pollution is a major issue that is harming marine life and ecosystems. A business involved in SustainAqua could focus on developing and promoting sustainable waste management practices, including reducing plastic waste and implementing effective recycling and waste treatment methods. This could involve working with local communities and governments to implement effective waste management practices, as well as developing new technologies and innovations to reduce waste and pollution.**

**Finally, SustainAqua also focuses on promoting sustainable tourism practices in coastal regions and SIDS. Tourism can have negative impacts on the marine environment, including damage to coral reefs and the depletion of marine resources. A business involved in SustainAqua could work with local communities and governments to develop sustainable tourism practices that minimize negative impacts on the marine environment while still providing economic benefits to the local community.**

**In summary, SustainAqua is a project aimed at promoting sustainable use and management of aquatic resources, with a focus on sustainable fishing practices, reduction of marine pollution, and sustainable tourism practices. By working with local communities and governments and implementing innovative solutions, businesses involved in SustainAqua can contribute to achieving SDG Goal 14: Life Below Water.**
