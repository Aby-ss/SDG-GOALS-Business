# Life on Land
**The fifteenth SDG goal, "Life on Land," aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity. It recognizes that land degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are major threats to sustainable development and human well-being. This goal encompasses efforts to combat desertification, restore degraded land and forests, conserve biodiversity and wildlife, and promote sustainable land use practices. It also focuses on enhancing the participation of local communities and indigenous peoples in land management and conservation, promoting sustainable forest management and reforestation, and combating illegal wildlife trade and poaching.**

## Targets and Parameters for SDG Goal 15 üóë

**SDG Goal 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, halt deforestation, and combat desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. The targets and parameters for this goal include:**

- **By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.**
- **By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.**
- **By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought, and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.**
- **By 2020, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.**
- **Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.**
- **Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources.**
- **Take action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products.**
- **By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.**
- **By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies, and accounts.**
- **Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems.**
- **Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation.**
- **Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities.**
- **Strengthen the participation of local communities in the management of protected areas, including through the use of traditional knowledge.**
- **By 2020, ensure that ecosystems and their services are valued and incorporated into accounting and reporting systems and national and local economic planning and decision-making.**
- **Promote the development and implementation of legal frameworks and incentives to promote sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems.**

**These targets and parameters focus on preserving and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, promoting sustainable forest management, combating desertification and land degradation, protecting biodiversity and endangered species, and integrating ecosystem values into national and local planning and economic decision-making. They also emphasize the importance of mobilizing financial resources and involving local communities in conservation efforts.**

### Business Ideas for Goal 15 üèó

**Here are some business ideas for SDG Goal 15 that include the use of software and economics:**

- **Forest monitoring software: Develop software that uses satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms to monitor deforestation and forest degradation in real-time. This software could be sold to governments, NGOs, and businesses to help them monitor their forest resources and take action to protect them.**
- **Sustainable agriculture management: Develop software that helps farmers manage their land more sustainably. This could include tools for precision agriculture, soil health monitoring, and water management. The software could be sold to farmers or provided as a service by agricultural consultants.**
- **Carbon offset marketplace: Create an online marketplace that allows businesses and individuals to buy and sell carbon credits. The platform could use blockchain technology to provide transparency and traceability in the carbon offset market. This could help incentivize businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and invest in sustainable practices.**
- **Biodiversity conservation consulting: Offer consulting services to businesses and governments on how to conserve biodiversity in their operations. This could include conducting biodiversity assessments, developing conservation plans, and implementing sustainable practices. The business could also develop software tools to support these services.**
- **Natural resource valuation: Develop software that helps businesses and governments value their natural resources, such as forests, water resources, and wildlife. This could help them make better decisions about how to manage these resources sustainably and avoid overexploitation.**

**A possible name for a business focusing on these ideas could be "EcoTech Solutions".**

**One way to address the issue of deforestation and unsustainable land use practices is through the use of remote sensing and satellite imagery technology. This involves using data from satellites to monitor land use practices, detect changes in vegetation cover, and identify areas at risk of deforestation or land degradation. The data can then be used to inform policies and decision-making around land use management, conservation, and restoration efforts.**

**A business idea based on this could involve developing software tools and analytics platforms that utilize remote sensing data to provide insights and recommendations for sustainable land use practices. For example, the software could help identify areas where forest conservation efforts should be prioritized, or provide guidance for sustainable agricultural practices that minimize the risk of soil degradation and deforestation.**

**In addition to providing a valuable service for environmental conservation and sustainable land use, this type of business could also have economic benefits. Governments, NGOs, and private companies may be willing to pay for access to the software and data insights in order to inform their land use decisions and mitigate their environmental impact.**

**Overall, this type of business could contribute to SDG 15 by promoting sustainable land use practices and reducing deforestation, while also providing economic benefits through the development and sale of software and data analytics services.**
