1. **Shop Local and In-Season ✅ Eating locally-grown foods helps to [support smaller-scale farmers](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/7_benefits_of_eating_local_foods) in one’s community. Buying in-season foods also helps sustain local, native crops and plants. Preserving native crops helps increase genetic diversity as it increases the number of plant species in a given area. Maintaining genetic diversity in food production across the globe is one of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 as this allows the [plants with favorable traits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383386/) — those that are resistant to pests or are able to provide higher yields — to proliferate.

2. **Reduce Food Waste ✅ Food waste is one of the greatest barriers to eradicating hunger as food that could serve food insecure populations instead ends up in landfills. According to [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/our-work/our-approach/reduce-food-waste), U.S. citizens waste “108 billion pounds of food” annually, equivalent to 130 billion discarded meals. However, food waste is not an issue unique to high-income countries: the U.N. Environment Programme’s “Food Waste Index Report 2021” has found that lower-middle-income nations annually discard [201 pounds of food](https://www.devex.com/news/un-report-countries-at-all-income-levels-waste-food-99323) per capita at the household level. In comparison, for high-income nations, this amount is 174 pounds per capita per year. To reduce food waste, people can freeze extra produce and save leftovers from meals. They can also buy “ugly” produce from the grocery store, which often ends up going to waste because it is less aesthetically desirable. However, the slightly misshapen produce found in grocery stores is still perfectly good to eat. In addition, staying informed on [anti-food waste initiatives](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/09/28/cutting-food-loss-and-waste-can-deliver-big-wins-for-countries-food-security-and-environment) in low- and middle-income countries helps to develop global awareness and better understand the progress that these countries are making toward achieving Zero Hunger.

3. **Reduce Meat Consumption. The U.S. imported [$216 million worth of beef](https://www.garrainternational.com/usa-triples-brazilian-beef-imports-in-2021/) from Brazil in the first nine months of 2021. Approximately [80% of deforestation](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/amazon_threats/unsustainable_cattle_ranching/) in the Amazon is due to cattle ranching. Deforestation can have negative impacts on food production thousands of miles away. For example, deforestation of the Amazon at 40% would [significantly decrease rainfall](https://www.climateandlandusealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Effects_of_Tropical_Deforestation_Policymaker_Summary.pdf) in the Rio de la Plata agricultural basin more than 2,000 miles away. Such droughts lead to decreased crop production, negatively impacting local farmers. To help mitigate the impact of the meat industry on deforestation, the U.N. has suggested that individuals consider vegetarianism for just a day per week. Just one day of vegetarianism could preserve “[3 million acres of land](https://vegnews.com/2017/7/the-environmental-impacts-of-going-vegetarian-for-just-one-day).” Even though those who live in North America may be physically far away from local farmers in the Amazon, individual eating habits still impact these farmers.**
4. **Support Organizations Focusing on SDG 2. Two organizations working to improve food security worldwide include the [Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition](https://www.gainhealth.org/) (GAIN) and the [World Food Program](https://www.wfpusa.org/) (WFP). GAIN focuses on providing aid to women, children and adolescents. One of its programs is [Better Diets for Children](https://www.gainhealth.org/impact/programmes/better-diets-children), which provides support to small-scale food manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to make nutritious, safe food more affordable and accessible. The program spans eight countries and aims to help more than 120 million people. The WFP provides food assistance to victims of extreme events, such as those facing natural disasters and conflict. The organization operates in more than 80 countries and provides [more than 15 billion life-saving meals](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2020-12-10/html/CREC-2020-12-10-pt1-PgS7418-2.htm) each year. One of the WFP’s programs is the [food assistance program](https://www.wfpusa.org/programs/food-cash/), which provides “cash-based assistance” so that families can afford nutritious food.**
5. **Stay Informed and Spread the Word. Staying updated on global hunger reduction initiatives is important for tracking progress made toward Sustainable Development Goal 2. The U.N. SDG website and [social media](https://www.instagram.com/TheGlobalGoals/) stand as great resources in this regard. It is also important to educate others about Sustainable Development Goal 2 by sharing ways that others can help and the organizations that people can support in achieving this goal. Social media serves as an essential tool for raising awareness of global issues.**

## AG Zone ♻
**AG Zone is a technology company that provides a farm planning software to farmers. Our software is designed to help farmers optimize their use of resources such as water, fertilizers, and energy, and increase their yields while promoting long-term sustainability. We are committed to contributing to SDG Goal 2 by enhancing farm efficiency, promoting sustainable land use, and increasing access to agricultural knowledge.**

**Our web-based platform provides real-time monitoring of crop growth and soil health, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilizer application, and other inputs. Our software also provides recommendations for crop rotation, soil health, and water management, among other things. It is designed to be easy to use and can be accessed on any device with an internet connection.**

**The market for farm planning software is growing rapidly, and we have identified several target markets for our software, including small-scale farmers, large-scale commercial farmers, and farming cooperatives and associations. We plan to use a combination of online and offline marketing channels to promote our software to these markets, including a website, targeted online ads, agricultural trade shows, and free trials.**

**AG Zone will run a pilot program to test the efficiency and workability of our software model. We will work with a small group of farmers to gather feedback and insights into how our software can be improved to better meet the needs of farmers. The pilot program will also allow us to demonstrate the value of our software to potential customers and refine our marketing and sales strategies. We will use the results of the pilot program to make necessary adjustments and ensure that our software is meeting the needs of our target markets.**
