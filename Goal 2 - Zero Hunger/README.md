**The second SDG goal, "Zero Hunger," centers around ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. It acknowledges that hunger and malnutrition are persistent global challenges that require comprehensive strategies. This goal encompasses efforts to increase agricultural productivity, enhance rural infrastructure, support small-scale farmers, ensure equitable access to land and resources, and promote sustainable farming practices. It also focuses on improving food systems, reducing food waste, and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change and other shocks. Achieving Zero Hunger entails not only increasing food production but also addressing systemic issues such as poverty, inequality, gender disparities, and lack of access to education and healthcare, which are closely intertwined with hunger and malnutrition.**

## Business Ideas 🧠

- ✅ **An urban farming business that grows fresh produce in unused urban spaces and sells it to local markets.**
- **A meal delivery service that uses surplus food to create nutritious meals for low-income families.**
- **A community garden program that provides free gardening space and resources for people to grow their own food.**
- **A food waste reduction program that works with grocery stores and restaurants to donate excess food to local charities.**
- **A food packaging company that uses sustainable materials and reduces food waste in the packaging process.**

## Zero Hunger SDG Goal 2 Target parameters and Expectations 📑

- **2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.**

## Tackling SDG Goal 2 : Zero Hunger ☁

1. **Shop Local and In-Season ✅ Eating locally-grown foods helps to [support smaller-scale farmers](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/7_benefits_of_eating_local_foods) in one’s community. Buying in-season foods also helps sustain local, native crops and plants. Preserving native crops helps increase genetic diversity as it increases the number of plant species in a given area. Maintaining genetic diversity in food production across the globe is one of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 as this allows the [plants with favorable traits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383386/) — those that are resistant to pests or are able to provide higher yields — to proliferate.

2. **Reduce Food Waste ✅ Food waste is one of the greatest barriers to eradicating hunger as food that could serve food insecure populations instead ends up in landfills. According to [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/our-work/our-approach/reduce-food-waste), U.S. citizens waste “108 billion pounds of food” annually, equivalent to 130 billion discarded meals. However, food waste is not an issue unique to high-income countries: the U.N. Environment Programme’s “Food Waste Index Report 2021” has found that lower-middle-income nations annually discard [201 pounds of food](https://www.devex.com/news/un-report-countries-at-all-income-levels-waste-food-99323) per capita at the household level. In comparison, for high-income nations, this amount is 174 pounds per capita per year. To reduce food waste, people can freeze extra produce and save leftovers from meals. They can also buy “ugly” produce from the grocery store, which often ends up going to waste because it is less aesthetically desirable. However, the slightly misshapen produce found in grocery stores is still perfectly good to eat. In addition, staying informed on [anti-food waste initiatives](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/09/28/cutting-food-loss-and-waste-can-deliver-big-wins-for-countries-food-security-and-environment) in low- and middle-income countries helps to develop global awareness and better understand the progress that these countries are making toward achieving Zero Hunger.

3. **Reduce Meat Consumption. The U.S. imported [$216 million worth of beef](https://www.garrainternational.com/usa-triples-brazilian-beef-imports-in-2021/) from Brazil in the first nine months of 2021. Approximately [80% of deforestation](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/amazon_threats/unsustainable_cattle_ranching/) in the Amazon is due to cattle ranching. Deforestation can have negative impacts on food production thousands of miles away. For example, deforestation of the Amazon at 40% would [significantly decrease rainfall](https://www.climateandlandusealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Effects_of_Tropical_Deforestation_Policymaker_Summary.pdf) in the Rio de la Plata agricultural basin more than 2,000 miles away. Such droughts lead to decreased crop production, negatively impacting local farmers. To help mitigate the impact of the meat industry on deforestation, the U.N. has suggested that individuals consider vegetarianism for just a day per week. Just one day of vegetarianism could preserve “[3 million acres of land](https://vegnews.com/2017/7/the-environmental-impacts-of-going-vegetarian-for-just-one-day).” Even though those who live in North America may be physically far away from local farmers in the Amazon, individual eating habits still impact these farmers.**
4. **Support Organizations Focusing on SDG 2. Two organizations working to improve food security worldwide include the [Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition](https://www.gainhealth.org/) (GAIN) and the [World Food Program](https://www.wfpusa.org/) (WFP). GAIN focuses on providing aid to women, children and adolescents. One of its programs is [Better Diets for Children](https://www.gainhealth.org/impact/programmes/better-diets-children), which provides support to small-scale food manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to make nutritious, safe food more affordable and accessible. The program spans eight countries and aims to help more than 120 million people. The WFP provides food assistance to victims of extreme events, such as those facing natural disasters and conflict. The organization operates in more than 80 countries and provides [more than 15 billion life-saving meals](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2020-12-10/html/CREC-2020-12-10-pt1-PgS7418-2.htm) each year. One of the WFP’s programs is the [food assistance program](https://www.wfpusa.org/programs/food-cash/), which provides “cash-based assistance” so that families can afford nutritious food.**
5. **Stay Informed and Spread the Word. Staying updated on global hunger reduction initiatives is important for tracking progress made toward Sustainable Development Goal 2. The U.N. SDG website and [social media](https://www.instagram.com/TheGlobalGoals/) stand as great resources in this regard. It is also important to educate others about Sustainable Development Goal 2 by sharing ways that others can help and the organizations that people can support in achieving this goal. Social media serves as an essential tool for raising awareness of global issues.**

## More on SDG Goal 2 : Zero Hunger 📖

**Hunger and malnutrition pose significant barriers to human wellbeing and economic development, with nearly one in eight people and one in four children suffering from chronic malnutrition. These pressures threaten to increase with intensifying pressures on natural resources, while impacts from climate change will also frustrate food systems. Further, farmers around the world, making up a large share of employment in developing countries, struggle to make a livelihood from agricultural activities.**

**Businesses play a central role in providing food to communities and combating hunger and malnutrition. Without careful management and safeguards, company operations can negatively impact the local food security of communities surrounding their operations and supply chain. A particular problem is abuse of land rights through land grabbing. Businesses in all sectors should ensure that land used throughout their supply chain is not, and has not, been taken without free, prior and informed consent from local communities. Companies can also negatively impact communities by restricting access to agricultural inputs including seeds, water supplies, knowledge and finance. Responsible supply chain practices that respect land rights and support smallholder farms can help two-thirds of the world’s population address hunger and achieve economic development. Business is also an emitter of greenhouse gasses, which contribute to climate change and thereby can exacerbate hunger through impacting yields.**

**Companies can provide leadership on Goal 2 to eliminate hunger. Business in the agriculture and food sectors, but also a variety of related sectors such as chemicals and biotechnology, are crucial to eliminating hunger through product and process innovation that reaches all global regions and communities. A key way to address hunger is by improving productivity and sustainability, market access, and access to opportunities for upgrading into more value-added activities for small-scale agriculture. This serves to provide more abundant and secure food supply for local communities and directly raise incomes of smallholder farmers. Companies can innovate, invest, and share knowledge to help increase the productivity of farmers in its supply chain and wider communities; and, they can restructure their supply chains such that a greater proportion of revenues goes to the farmers and their workers by reducing the need for intermediaries that exploit their vulnerability for their own gain. Companies can also lead by improving food distribution channels to combat malnutrition in areas with limited access to healthy foods and develop fortified crops and processed foods that are compatible with development goals for human and environmental health. To combat the significant global food waste problem, companies can lead in the development of technologies and processes to eliminate food waste from their end-to-end operations, to ensure better food availability to communities around the world.**

**Businesses can benefit from ending hunger as it allows them to access new and previously underserved markets. Further, existing malnutrition levels are estimated to be as high as 11 per cent of national GDP per year. The greatest market opportunities today are also the areas seeing the fastest population growth, which will increase demand for food up to 200 per cent from current levels by 2050. In many cases, reducing food waste directly improves the financial baseline: deploying sustainable agricultural solutions and reducing food loss and waste are each projected to deliver over $650 billion in annual value by 2030.**

**Eliminating hunger and improving agricultural incomes can have direct positive impacts on advancing Goals 1, 3 and 8 by increasing rural and developing country incomes and access to nutrition. Given the high rate of women farmers, especially in Africa and Asia, progress on Goal 2 can also further efforts to achieve gender equality (Goal 5). At the same time, businesses should be careful to reduce the risk of negative impacts. Intensive agricultural practices risk water scarcity and pollution (Goal 6), greenhouse gas emissions (Goal 13) and soil degradation (Goal 15). Leading businesses manage these risks through support for sustainable farming practices.**
