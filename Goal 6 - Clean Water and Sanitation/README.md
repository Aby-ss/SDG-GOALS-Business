# Clean Water and sanitation
**The sixth SDG goal, "Clean Water and Sanitation," aims to ensure access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for all. It recognizes that lack of access to WASH is a major public health issue and a driver of poverty and inequality. This goal encompasses efforts to improve water quality and availability, expand access to basic sanitation facilities and hygiene services, and promote sustainable water resource management. It also focuses on addressing gender disparities and promoting the participation of communities in water and sanitation management.**

## Business Ideas for SDG Goal 6 üèó

**Here are some potential business ideas for SDG Goal 6:**

1. **Water purification systems: In areas where access to clean water is limited, there is a high demand for affordable water purification systems. Entrepreneurs can develop and market water filtration systems that are affordable, easy to use and maintain, and effective at removing contaminants.**
2. **Wastewater management: Many communities lack the infrastructure to treat and dispose of wastewater safely. Entrepreneurs can develop systems for treating wastewater that are efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.**
3. **Water conservation technology: As water scarcity becomes more of a concern, there is a growing need for technology that can help conserve water. Entrepreneurs can develop smart irrigation systems, leak detection technology, and other tools to help people and businesses use water more efficiently.**
4. **Rainwater harvesting: In areas where rainfall is abundant, rainwater harvesting can be a sustainable solution for providing water for household use and irrigation. Entrepreneurs can develop and market rainwater harvesting systems that are affordable and easy to install.**
5. **Water education and awareness: Many people are not aware of the importance of water conservation or the consequences of water pollution. Entrepreneurs can develop educational programs, campaigns, and products to raise awareness and encourage behavior change.**
6. **Eco-tourism: Ecotourism is a growing industry that can have a positive impact on water resources. Entrepreneurs can develop sustainable tourism activities that promote conservation of water resources, such as guided tours of wetlands or waterfalls.**
7. **Water-efficient products: Entrepreneurs can develop and market products that are designed to conserve water, such as low-flow showerheads, toilets, and faucets. These products can be targeted at residential, commercial, and industrial customers.**

**These are just a few examples of business ideas that align with SDG Goal 6. By addressing the challenges related to water and sanitation, entrepreneurs have the opportunity to create innovative solutions that have a positive impact on communities and the environment.**

# CleanStream üß™

**Water purification systems are essential for communities without access to clean water. These systems can help remove contaminants and bacteria from water sources, making it safe to drink and use for household purposes. Entrepreneurs can develop affordable, easy-to-use water filtration systems that can be used in homes, schools, and community centers in areas where clean water is scarce.**

**One potential approach is to create low-cost, portable water filters that can be easily transported and distributed to areas in need. These filters could use materials such as activated carbon and ceramic filters to remove contaminants, and could be designed to be used with a variety of water sources, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. The filters could also be designed to require minimal maintenance, making them a practical solution for communities with limited resources.**

**Another approach is to develop larger-scale water treatment systems that can be installed in areas where access to clean water is limited. These systems could use advanced technologies such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection, and membrane filtration to purify water at a larger scale. These systems could also be designed to be energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable, using renewable energy sources such as solar power to operate.**

**To make these water purification systems financially sustainable, entrepreneurs could explore various business models such as social enterprise or pay-for-use models. In a social enterprise model, profits from the sale of the water filtration systems could be reinvested back into the business to expand operations and increase impact. In a pay-for-use model, communities could pay a fee to use the water filtration systems, ensuring ongoing maintenance and sustainability of the systems.**

**By developing innovative and sustainable water purification systems, entrepreneurs can help address the critical need for clean water in communities around the world.**

**Natural freshwater sources in the UAE are scarce and limited to groundwater. The government is increasingly relying on desalinated water, which is produced using excess heat from power generation. This issue has impacted the marine environment due to the discharge of highly concentrated seawater into the Arabian Gulf, among other things.

Groundwater is the only natural freshwater supply in the UAE. The government is becoming more reliant on desalinated water, which is produced from waste heat from power plants. The flow of highly concentrated seawater into the Arabian Gulf, among other things, has had an impact on the marine ecology**

# Solution

**This problem can be solved by developing an innovative machine that generates heat utilising electric boilers driven by solar panels. Due to the UAE's hot and arid climate, solar energy is one of the most efficient means of producing sustainable energy while preserving fossil fuels and emitting no carbon dioxide.

A device which has :**

- **Solar Panels (which generate electricity):**
    - More water sprays to keep them clean
    - Avoid dust accumulation, which might limit efficiency.
    - Have motors beneath them that face the sun at all times, simulating Sunflower
- **Electric Boilers (generate heat using solar panel energy):**
    - Electric boilers are significantly more efficient than burning fossil fuels
    - They are much faster at accomplishing their task
    - They emit very little to no emissions
- **Water is desalinated and stored separately, whilst salt is held as extra material that could be used or sold.**
